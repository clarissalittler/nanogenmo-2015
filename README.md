## Idea 1: Rotations
The idea here is that we take some free text, such as project gutenberg or creative commons material etc., and then we "rotate" sections of the text to create new ones. We keep sentences intact, but rotate paragraphs around each other, sentences within paragraphs, and chapters within the larger text. Just rearrange things and see if anything interesting happens. There might be some heuristics that will change things without actually 

## Idea 2: Markov Experiments
So I've known the rough idea of markov chains and that they can be used to generate randomized content for ages, but I've never actually *done* anything with that.

This is a really really good time to start!

In particular, I'm fascinated with the work on generating fairy tales! It's so cool and at the very least it would be an excuse to read some papers.
## Idea 3: Tumblr Tags
So Tumblr tags are, generally, super interesting in terms of what people put in the tags but not in the posts themselves. Writing a little Haskell API library to Tumblr and then nabbing posts through, say, a configurable set of searches and taking their tags and somehow combining them into text. You might get a ton of gibberish, you might get some really interesting freak-poetry. Who knows! I think, though, that with enough posts you could probably get 50k words worth of tags.
